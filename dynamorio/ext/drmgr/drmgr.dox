\page page_drmgr Multi-Instrumentation Manager

The \p drmgr DynamoRIO Extension provides a mediator for combining and
coordinating multiple instrumentation passes.  It replaces certain
DynamoRIO events and API routines with its own versions that mediate among
multiple components, typically several libraries and one client, though it
is also useful for splitting a client up into modules.  \p drmgr
facilitates developing instrumentation frameworks and libraries that can be
composed and combined.

\section sec_drmgr_setup Setup

To use \p drmgr with your client simply include this line in your client's
\p CMakeLists.txt file:

\code use_DynamoRIO_extension(clientname drmgr) \endcode

That will automatically set up the include path and library dependence.

The \p drmgr_init() function must be called only once, so typically a
library that uses \p drmgr will not invoke it and will require that the end
user (the client) invoke it prior to the library's initialization routine.

\section sec_drmgr_stages Instrumentation Stages

\p drmgr divides code changes into three types:

 -# Application-to-application transformations: changes to the application
    code itself that are meant to affect application behavior or
    application performance
 -# Instrumentation insertion: monitoring code added between the
    application instructions
 -# Instrumentation-to-instrumentation transformations: typically,
    optimizations applied to the full set of inserted instrumentation

Instrumentation insertion is split into two pieces: analysis of the full
application code (after any changes from its original form), followed by
insertion of instrumentation, one instruction at a time.  The result is
four separate, sequential stages:

 -# Application-to-application transformations
 -# Application code analysis
 -# Instrumentation insertion, one instruction at a time
 -# Instrumentation-to-instrumentation transformations

Each component that registers with \p drmgr can register for some or all of
the four stages.  In each stage, each registered compoment's callback is
invoked.  This groups the different types of changes together and allows
them to assume that no later change will invalidate their analysis or
actions.  The instrumentation insertion is performed in one forward pass:
for each instruction, each registered component is invoked.  This simplifies
register allocation (register allocation is provided by a separate
Extension \p drreg).

\subsection sec_drmgr_ordering Ordering

The proper ordering of instrumentation passes depends on the particulars of
what each pass is doing.  \p drmgr supports naming each pass and specifying
relative ordering by requesting that one pass occur before and/or after
another named pass.  Numeric priorities are also supported for resolving
order among identical placement once named ordering is resolved.

Some ordering rules do apply.  For example, function replacing should occur
before most other application transformations.  Ordering of instrumentation
insertion and especially instrumentation-to-instrumentation transformations
can be highly dependent on exact transformations involved.  Care should be taken when
ordering passes within each stage.

\subsection sec_drmgr_traces Traces

\p drmgr does not mediate trace instrumentation.  Those interested in hot
code should use the \p drmgr basic block events and act only when the \p
for_trace parameter is set.   Those wanting to optimize the longer code
sequences in traces are on their own for register allocation, and must be
careful to handle instrumentation that has already been added from the
basic block events.

\section sec_drmgr_tls Thread-Local and Callback-Local Storage

\p drmgr also coordinates sharing of the thread-local-storage field among
multiple components and provides automated support for callback-private
fields on Windows.  It replaces the single #dr_get_tls_field() pointer with
two separate arrays of pointers: one for callback-shared fields, and one
for callback-private fields.  When a field is requested, an integer index
is returned to the caller for use in retrieving the appropriate pointer.

\subsection sec_drmgr_cls Callback-local Storage

On Windows, events such as keypresses or mouse movements are delivered to
applications as \e callbacks.  These callbacks interrupt a thread's
execution in order to handle the event.  The interrupted context is saved
and a new context entered.  When the event handling is finished, the
interrupted context is resumed.  Callbacks can interrupt other callbacks,
resulting in a stack of contexts.

When a tool maintains state across application execution, it must handle
callback contexts.  Thread-local storage (tls) is per-thread and is thus
callback-shared.  Callbacks interrupt thread execution to execute arbitrary
amounts of code in a new context before returning to the interrupted
context.  Thread-local storage fields that persist across application
execution can be overwritten during callback execution, resulting in
incorrect values when returning to the original context.  Callback-local
storage, rather than thread-local storage, should be used for any fields
that store information specific to the application's execution.

Callbacks are Windows-specific.  The cls interfaces are not marked
for Windows-only, however, to facilitate cross-platform code.  We
recommend that cross-plaform code be written using cls fields on
both platforms; the fields on Linux will never be stacked and will
function as tls fields.  Technically the same context interruption
can occur with a Linux signal, but Linux signals typically execute
small amounts of code and avoid making stateful changes;
furthermore, there is no guaranteed end point to a signal.  The
drmgr_push_cls() and drmgr_pop_cls() interface can be used to
provide a stack of contexts on Linux, or to provide a stack of
contexts for any other purpose such as layered wrapped functions.
These push and pop functions are automatically called on Windows
callback entry and exit.

\section sec_drmgr_notes Instruction Note Fields

Instrumentation passes often need to mark instructions with information for
later passes.  One method of doing this is to use the \p note field built
in to the \p instr_t type.  For example, labels can be inserted with \p
note field corresponding to pre-defined constants to indicate insertion
points.  In order to avoid these \p note constants from overlapping and
conflicting among different passes, \p drmgr provides mediation of the
\note namespace.

\p drmgr does not make use of its \p note mediation mandatory and does not
override instr_set_note() or instr_get_note().  Instrumentation passes
should feel free to use pointer values in the \p note field.  The \p note
constant value mediation is intended for small constants that will note be
confused with pointer values.
